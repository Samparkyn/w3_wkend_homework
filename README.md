Week 3, Weekend homework - Bookmarks webpage app

A bookmarks webapp page. You can add bookmarks of the links to your favourite websites.
You can include a title, url, description and a genre. You can then view all your previous bookmarks, edit them or delete them.

The theme I went with was Elephants.. because elephants never forget, so they'll never forget your bookmarks!
So it became EleBookMarkz. 

I found it a challenge to get the css to look decent enough (still not sure i'm 100% happy with it.. and this was after several 
other ideas had been tryed and tested!)
But I really enjoyed creating everything from scratch. Sinatra is a great tool, and I'm understanding the RESTful way of 
writing the code :) 
Also SQL is cool, I like the way it seems so simple to just create a table with all the data you want in it.
Very cool to see it all coming together with a database, some backend and some frontend :)
